# Headline-Generation 

Recent advances in deep learning have lead to an explosion of research in the field, both applied and theoretical. Research has focused on a breadth of different areas, with large amounts narrowing in on image and text processing. A [fascinating paper](http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/2015/reports/1.pdf) that I have recently read attempts to predict headlines of news articles using the article text as input. 

This paper has applications for *text summarization* across any body of text, and as such I wanted to dive in! 

## Current Status

At this point, I've been able to overfit and perfectly predict a small training set (5 body/headline pairs) with the pre-processing and architecture I have set up. Now it's time to crank up the juice!
